# Thesis Simulations
simulation cases for 2 fluids in to explore result accuracy with changes in mesh fineness

### Structure
Every simulation case contains the generated parameters and the results of the computation

### Files

`worker.ipynb`
creates the simulation cases

`main.jl`
runs the computations

`plot.py`
parses and plots the results
